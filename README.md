# TaskFlow


TaskFlow is a framework designed to provide a flexible way to define and execute task flows. It organizes task nodes in a graphical manner, supporting concurrent execution, timeout control, and error handling.

## Features
- Graphical Task Definition: Define task flow graphs using JSON files.
- Concurrent Execution: Supports concurrent execution of task nodes to improve efficiency.
- Timeout Control: Set timeout for each task node.
- Error Handling: Supports error ignoring, pruning, and abort strategies.
- Visualization: Generate visual graphs of task flows.

## TODO
- Improve Operator Builder logic
- Improve viz graph display outcome
- Support more operator middleware
- Provide more example 
- Improve subgraph execution logic and fix relate bugs
